# Multiple Linear Regression

- With the house prices data from Kaggle, I built a model using regression techniques to predict house sales. The accuracy value shows the model is quite reliable.

- Also, I built a similar model at work to investigate the customers' shopping behaviour during LNY and Valentine's day. The result shows that the sales of scarves and bags are highly associated with the total sales during LNY; whereas the sales of bags and rainwear have a strong relationship with the total spend per client during the campaign of Valentine's day.
